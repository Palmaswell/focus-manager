## The Problem
Developing accessible web sites and applications is not easy. Yet, it's our responsibility as developers to include as many people in our applications as we can. A Keyboard navigation implementation should be consistent across all sites but flexible enough to create new flows and interactions.

## The Solution
`@palmaswelll/focus-manager` is a Keyboard and Focus manager **context provider** that allows you to implement keyboard navigation flows in React applications. It registers, tracks, and delegate events to DOM elements or React components.

## Installation
This module is distributed via npm and should be installed as one of your project's dependencies:

**npm**
``` 
npm install --save @palmaswelll/keyboard-manager
npm install --save @palmaswelll/focus-manager
```
or

**yarn**
``` 
yarn add @palmaswelll/keyboard-manager
yarn add @palmaswelll/focus-manager
```
